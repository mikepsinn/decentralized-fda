- always keep in mind the core goal of creating the simplest possible library that will calculate the secondary outcomes of an intervention with sufficient detail and rigor to help a government official decide whether or not to fund an intervention. 
- Keep the [README.md](mdc:README.md) updated with check marks indicating what's complete and what's next to implement
- Refer to [README.md](mdc:README.md) regularly to avoid deviation
- Use ts for data files
- Run `pnpm type-check`, `pnpm format`, and `pnpm lint` regularly and fix problems before moving to new features 
- Do not change [types.ts](mdc:src/types.ts)! Make sure all the data files you generate match the types defined there.
- The [README.md](mdc:README.md) is the single source of truth and [types.ts](mdc:src/types.ts) should mirror it perfectly
